It's almost GoT's final season, and it's getting harder to keep track of who belongs to which house and who's dead or alive. Help GoT fans by creating an informative list of the main noble houses of Westeros, and three characters from the show

## Noble Houses

Create a House class that contains:
 - House name.
 - Sigil.
 - Words.
 - Array of Enemies. 
 - Method `houseInfo()` that displays the name, sigil and words of the house.
 - Method `newEnemy(name)` that adds a new enemy to the house.
